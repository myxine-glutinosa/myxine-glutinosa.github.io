                Hagfish "eyes" are so primitive that it's debatable whether they can be called <i>eyes</i> in the proper sense. People have some very mean things to say about hagfish vision:
            <ul>
              <li>★★★☆☆ Eyes (Hagfish Biology chapter 5)</li>
              <li>★★☆☆☆ "Eyes" (Hagfish Biology chapter 5)</li>
              <li>★★☆☆☆ Eyespots</li>
              <li>★☆☆☆☆ starkly rudimentary eye (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.265124v1.full)</li>
              <li>★☆☆☆☆ rudimentary hagfish retina (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.265124v1.full)</li>
              <li>★☆☆☆☆ hagfish eyes are strikingly rudimentary (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8826474/)</li>
              <li>★☆☆☆☆ poorly developed visual [...] systems (https://karger.com/bbe/article-abstract/48/5/262/42399/The-Sensory-Biology-of-the-Living-Jawless-Fishes-A?redirectedFrom=fulltext)</li>
            </ul>
            Poor fellas ☹. So what's all the fuss about?

                But it wasn't always this way! Probably. There is <i>some</i> support among hag-heads for the idea that hagifsh once had more developed eyes and simply evolved simpler eyes
                - after all, there isn't much use for vision when you're in the deep sea! Evidence is limited though: hagfish have a teensy-weensy fossil record (see <a href="fossils.html">Fossils</a>),
               and eyes don't fossilise well to begin with (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8826474/#B17).
